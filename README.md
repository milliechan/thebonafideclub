## Inspiration 
----
The Bonafide Club is the dating site for genuine people. We believe that past experience is incredibly powerful when harnessed to inform your future. 

## What it does
----
The Bona Fide Club uses your own voice to speak for you. We use your profile, past conversations, and public data you've published, combined with the power of IBM Watson, to create an "authenticity score" that illustrates to other Club members that you're here for genuine interactions.

## How we built it 
----
We built The Bona Fide Club primarily with Ruby-on-Rails connected to a Domain.com-provided dot-club domain, incorporating the Twilio IP Messaging API Beta for high-quality one-to-one conversations, and a backend handling the heavy-lifting IBM Watson processing with Bash and Python.

## Accomplishments 
----
The Bona Fide Club site itself is in excellent condition (at least, from an engineer's perspective) and we are proud to have learned to use the new Twilio IP Messaging API and the IBM Watson Personality Insights API - both are fascinating!

## Code 
----
Our code is hosted in two repositories; one for the Rails front-end connected to the Twilio API, and the second for the Bash/Python backend connected to IBM Watson.
